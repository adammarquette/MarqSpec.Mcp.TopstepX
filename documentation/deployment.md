# Deployment

**Deployment is Docker-based.** This repository ships a container image built from the root
[`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile). CI exercises that build on every pull request; a published GitHub release
pushes the same image to GHCR ([ADR-0001](adr/0001-tag-driven-versioning.md)). Nothing in this repository
provisions a cloud account or runs `cdk deploy`.

The AWS CDK application under `infra/` and the GitHub Actions jobs that assumed OIDC roles into AWS were
removed (gh#509, gh#520, gh#522–#525, gh#678, gh#682). [ADR-0023](adr/0023-aws-deployment-topology.md)
records that history and is **superseded** for where the server runs; the product shape in
[ADR-0021](adr/0021-a-non-loopback-instance-is-supported.md) still applies when you expose the HTTP
transport beyond loopback.

## Local stack (development)

The default path is [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml) with optional
[`docker-compose.dev.yml`](../docker-compose.dev.yml). Copy [`.env.example`](../.env.example) to `.env`,
provide ProjectX credentials and (for HTTPS on `:8443`) a host-trusted certificate as described in the
[README](../README.md#run-it).

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Postgres uses the Timescale image declared in compose; the server container runs the image this
repository builds.

## Published image (staging / production)

After a release, pull from GHCR using the tag that matches the release (without the leading `v` on the
image tag — see [ADR-0001](adr/0001-tag-driven-versioning.md)) or pin by digest from the release workflow
output.

Resolve the image reference the same way CI and release do:

```bash
./scripts/image-reference.sh
```

Run the container with the environment variables your deployment needs — auth mode, connection string,
ProjectX tier, TLS material, optional OTLP endpoint — as documented in the README and
[architecture](architecture.md). Use the same [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile) entrypoint and layout CI
builds; do not substitute a different Postgres major or strip Timescale if you expect parity with tests
([ADR-0004](adr/0004-one-postgres-timescale-pgvector.md)).

For a multi-container layout, start from compose: replace build contexts with `image:` pointing at the
GHCR reference, set secrets through your orchestrator's mechanism instead of a tracked `.env`, and keep
the server behind TLS when the instance is reachable off the machine
([ADR-0021](adr/0021-a-non-loopback-instance-is-supported.md)).

## Verify a running instance

[`scripts/check-deployment.sh`](../scripts/check-deployment.sh) probes a **deployed** HTTPS origin from
outside the process: `/health`, OAuth metadata, token exchange, and MCP `initialize` / `tools/list`. It is
not tied to AWS; pass the base URL and the release version you expect:

```bash
MCP_CHECK_CLIENT_ID=… MCP_CHECK_CLIENT_SECRET=… MCP_CHECK_TOKEN_URL=… \
  scripts/check-deployment.sh https://your-host.example 0.4.0
```

CI runs [`check-deployment-selftest.sh`](../scripts/check-deployment-selftest.sh) against a loopback
fixture so that gate can still fail without a live deployment.

## Release and rollback (image only)

1. Merge to `develop`, promote through the branch policy, cut a `v*` tag on `main`, and publish the GitHub
   release — `release.yml` builds and pushes to GHCR after the `production` environment approval.
2. On the host where you run Docker, `docker pull` the new tag (or digest), update your compose or run
   command, and restart the server (and migrate Postgres if the release requires it).
3. **Rollback** is the previous image tag or digest: pull that reference and restart. GHCR tags can be
   overwritten; prefer digest pinning for production.
